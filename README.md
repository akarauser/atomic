Habit Tracker App

This script is a simple habit tracker application built using the textual library. It allows users to log habits, mark tasks as completed, and track progress through experience points. Key best practices include modular design with clean separation of concerns, effective use of reactive components for real-time updates, and comprehensive error handling for robustness. The app employs a JSON-based data storage system to persist user profiles and task data across sessions.
